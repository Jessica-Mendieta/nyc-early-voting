#### Background
During the last week of September, a [story broke out](https://gothamist.com/news/brooklyn-voters-receive-absentee-ballot-envelopes-wrong-voter-names-and-addresses?fbclid=IwAR21jhwVsfbvlce2QMpIHcMk3P84ZSwJANl7Q32qgMQ0wef0XwhBQiY4dSo) that showed thousands of voters in Brooklyn had received absentee ballots with incorrect information. This raised concerns about voter disenfranchisement and the vendor selection process, as well as voters' faith in the Board of Elections at the state and local level - this followed a lengthy process to count all ballots after the June primary. While the root of the error has not been addressed, this story showed that early in person voting is one of the best ways to make sure each vote is counted. I made the map to show any poll site concentrations, whether they are in areas that are accessible to residents, and to introduce a template for future elections that makes it easier to have this same information (location and voting period) translated and for community organizations to develop outreach strategies to increase voter turnout safely.
